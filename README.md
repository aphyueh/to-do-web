# TodoBreeze - React Website

TodoBreeze is a responsive web application built with React and Tailwind CSS, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently with a clean and intuitive interface. It features user authentication (login and signup) and a to-do list with progress tracking. The app is deployed on Vercel and integrates with a GraphQL backend hosted on AWS Lambda.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality using GraphQL mutations.
- **To-Do List Management**: Add, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar displaying the percentage of completed tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **GraphQL Backend**: Integrates with a backend hosted on AWS Lambda ([to-do-backend](https://github.com/aphyueh/to-do-backend)).
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel for fast and reliable performance ([Live Demo](https://to-do-website-liard.vercel.app/)).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Apollo Client (for GraphQL queries/mutations)
- **Backend**: GraphQL API hosted on AWS Lambda ([to-do-backend](https://github.com/aphyueh/to-do-backend))
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A running instance of the GraphQL backend ([to-do-backend](https://github.com/aphyueh/to-do-backend))
